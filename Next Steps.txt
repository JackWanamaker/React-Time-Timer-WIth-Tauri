Okay, so now I want to implement a button that handles the resetting of the time to 0. 

Ideally, I would like to change how the BackSpace works, because honestly it is unnecessary to handle it in handleChange if I can instead do it inside of the backspace handler! Which is very cool! But alas, it works right now, so I am going to leave it. It is a bit spaghetti though...

So I am going to need a new div. I use the same CSS file I did for the other stuff for the TimerInput. So TimerInput.css? No, App.css...

I also really need to fix the fact that part of BackSpace doesn't work right :-( So maybe I
should just do it...

Okay so my next steps are to figure out how to put the items in the div in the same line as one another... And also remove the
button border for that specific item...
