For some reason when I put the digit in the [0,2] spot it gets sent to the [0,0] spot?!? Same happens in the [1,2] spot

So right now it replaces the first value, so look for that case

So it has something to do with line 48s return I think...

So I think I need to change the values inside of the next input instead of the current one, but how?!?
I could change the timerValue, but I think that would cause problems to be honest...

if (boxIndex == 0) {
                    setTimerValue([timerValue[0], e.target.value[2] + timerValue[1].slice(1), timerValue[2]]);
                }
                else {
                    setTimerValue([timerValue[0], timerValue[1], e.target.value[2] + timerValue[2].slice(2)]);
                }

Also, right now when a resume happens, it resets the circle to the current time left value. Fixed!!!
